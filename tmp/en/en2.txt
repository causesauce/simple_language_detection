1-layer Neural Network

Implement 1-layer neural network that can recognize the language of given text . Program should

work on any number of languages(unknown).

Program should count the proportion of each ascii letter in a text. Input vector has 26 elements.

Neural network should have as many neurons as languages in a train set. It has to recognize the number of languages automatically.

Use maximum selector to calculate the output. Try to normalize weight vector to improve classification.

You should create training and test datasets by yourself. Create folders for train and test sets. In each create folderrs that represents languages (pl, en, de ...) . Each language folder should contain a few

text files in particular language (i .e. articles from wikipedia) in different files in a folders

representing languages . Program should provide the language for each file

in a testset. Provide an interface to input a short text for language classification.
