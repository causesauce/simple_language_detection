1-layer Neural Network

Implement 1-layer neural network that can recognize the language of given text . Program should

work on any number of languages(unknown).

Program should count the proportion of each ascii letter in a text. Input vector has 26 elements.

Neural network should have as many neurons as languages in a train set. It has to recognize the number of languages automatically.

Use maximum selector to calculate the output. Try to normalize weight vector to improve classification.

You should create training and test datasets by yourself. Create folders for train and test sets. In each create folderrs that represents languages (pl, en, de ...) . Each language folder should contain a few

text files in particular language (i .e. articles from wikipedia) in different files in a folders

representing languages . Program should provide the language for each file

in a testset. Provide an interface to input a short text for language classification. The couple were tied up with electrical cords, physically assaulted and robbed of their jewellery.

Bernard Tapie, 78, who is a former French finance minister, is a flamboyant and controversial figure.

He has been at the centre of legal battles concerning corruption and fraud for decades, and spent time in jail.

Mr Tapie and his wife, Dominique, 70, were sleeping when four men slipped passed security guards and broke into their home around 00:30 on Sunday (22:30 GMT Saturday).

The intruders pulled Mrs Tapie by the hair "because they wanted to know where the treasure was", the mayor of Combs-La-Ville, Guy Geoffroy, told AFP.

"But of course there was no treasure, and the fact that they didn't find it made the violence only worse."

Mr Tapie was hit over the head with a club while sitting in a chair.

Managing to free herself, Dominique Tapie ran to a neighbour's home and called the police. She suffered facial injuries after being hit several times, and was taken to hospital.
